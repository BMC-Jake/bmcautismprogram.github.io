        <h2>About The Autism Program at BMC</h2><br>
        <p><span>The Autism Program at Boston Medical Center (BMC)</span> assists individuals and families affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through direct patient support, provider education, and community-based outreach.</p>
    <p>Our team of Resource Specialists and Family Navigators offers specialized outreach, training, and advocacy services, forms effective partnerships with schools, collaborates with local organizations, and draws upon a deep knowledge base of social service agencies to facilitate linkages to critical resources.</p>
    <p><span>The Autism Friendly Initiative</span> aims to improve the hospital experience for patients with ASD. Patients with ASD have various sensory and communication needs, which, when combined with the fast-paced and often over-stimulating hospital environment, can present obstacles to quality healthcare experiences.</p>
